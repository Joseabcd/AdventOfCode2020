# AdventOfCode2020

### What?
My solutions to the coding challenges from the 2020 version of The Advent of Code (found here https://adventofcode.com/2020),
programmed using Wolfram Language (aka Mathematica).

### How?
They're formatted as Wolfram Language Scripts so that they can be visualized and run without need of installing the Mathematica front end,
by only installing the free interpreter (downloadable from [here](https://www.wolfram.com/wolframscript/)). 

Each script can be run by first making it executable (running in a terminal `chmod +x filename.wls`), and then executing it simply by double-clicking 
on it (or alternatively typing `./filename.wls` in a terminal), within a folder that contains both the script and a text file with the puzzle input named "input.txt".
