# AdventOfCode2020

### What?
My solutions to the coding challenges from the 2020 version of The Advent of Code (found here https://adventofcode.com/2020),
programmed using Wolfram Language (aka Mathematica).

### How?
They're formatted as Wolfram Language Scripts so that they can be visualized and run without need of installing the Mathematica front end,
by only installing the free interpreter (downloadable from [here](https://www.wolfram.com/wolframscript/)). The actual pieces of code
appear in the scripts as comments wrapped between `(*...*)`, and below a headline delimiting each section. 

Each script can be run in a terminal by first making it executable (running `chmod +x filename.wls`) and then actually running it doing `./filename.wls < input.txt`,
where `input.txt` is the file containing the puzzle input located within the same folder as the script.
